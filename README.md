ATMs are unmanned machines designed for cash transactions, allowing customers to access their accounts anytime. They provide withdrawal and deposit services, offer touchscreen interfaces, and display instructions to guide users. ATMs retrieve card data, display relevant information, and prompt customers to choose their payment method. For withdrawals exceeding 10,000 units, additional authentication like facial recognition or mobile OTP may be required.# intelrepo
